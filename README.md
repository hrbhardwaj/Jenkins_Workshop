# Jenkins_Workshop

## Deployment 
In this Deployment Jenkinsfile:

* We define environment variables for Kubernetes configuration (KUBECONFIG), Docker registry credentials (DOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS), your application's name (APP_NAME), 
   and the image tag.
* There are stages for checking out your source code, building a Docker image, pushing it to a container registry, deploying it to Kubernetes, and cleaning up any resources.
* In the "Deploy to Kubernetes" stage, we use kubectl to apply the Kubernetes manifests for your application, and we also wait for the deployment to complete.
* In the post section, we define actions to take based on the success or failure of the pipeline.

  ## Jenkins_Backup-InS3

This pipeline script will create a backup of the Jenkins home directory, compress it as a tar.gz file,   
  and then upload it to the specified S3 bucket.

  # Scheduled_Backup

  This pipeline can be scheduled to create backups of your application's data or configuration files regularly. 
  It's useful for disaster recovery and data protection.
