This pipeline can be scheduled to create backups of your application's data or configuration files regularly. 
  It's useful for disaster recovery and data protection.


pipeline {
    agent any
    
    triggers {
        cron('0 2 * * *') // Run at 2 AM every day
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Backup') {
            steps {
                // Create backups (e.g., database dumps, file backups, etc.)
            }
        }
        
        stage('Transfer to Backup Server') {
            steps {
                // Copy backups to a backup server or cloud storage
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Notify about successful backups
        }
        failure {
            // Notify about backup failures, investigate, and take action
        }
    }
}
